# 📊 COVID-19 Global Data Analysis – NSP Nexus Week 3 Project

## 🔍 Project Title:
**Analyzing Global COVID-19 Data Using Pandas and Matplotlib**

---

## 📁 Dataset Used
- **Source**: [Our World in Data]
- **File**: `owid-covid-data.csv`
- **Main Columns Used**:
  - `date`
  - `location`
  - `total_cases`
  - `new_cases`
  - `total_deaths`
  - `population`
  - `continent`

---

## 🎯 Objective
Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on global COVID-19 data to:

- Understand trends in confirmed and new cases over time
- Compare total cases and deaths across countries
- Visualize India's case growth and death rate
- Derive key insights using data visualization

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used
- **Python**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `seaborn`
  - `numpy`

---

## 📈 Key Visualizations & Tasks Completed
- ✅ Loaded and cleaned COVID-19 data
- ✅ Top 10 countries by total confirmed cases (bar chart)
- ✅ Trend of new cases over time for India, USA, and Brazil (line plot)
- ✅ Bar chart: Total deaths vs. total recoveries (if recoveries available)
- ✅ India's case growth over time (line plot)
- ✅ Calculated and plotted India's death rate:
  \[
  \text{Death Rate (\%)} = \left( \frac{\text{total\_deaths}}{\text{total\_cases}} \right) \times 100
  \]

---

## 📌 Insights Gained
- The USA, India, and Brazil had the highest total cases globally.
- India's case growth showed clear waves in the pandemic timeline.
- Death rates remained relatively stable despite rising case numbers.
- Visualizations helped clearly understand regional and global trends.
